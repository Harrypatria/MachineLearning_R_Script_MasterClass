### Machine Learning with R

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to learn patterns from data, and then using those patterns to make predictions or decisions about new data. R is a popular programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, with a variety of packages and functions available for machine learning.

One common dataset used in machine learning examples is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about various factors that may influence the value of homes in the Boston area. In this example, we will use this dataset to demonstrate the CRISP (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) process for data mining, feature selection using explainable AI techniques, and deriving actionable insights from the resulting model.

Next, we will follow the CRISP process, which involves several stages of data preparation, modeling, and evaluation. The stages are:
- Business Understanding
- Data Understanding
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment
For the purposes of this example, we will focus on stages 2-5.

### Data Understanding
Before we can begin modeling, we need to understand the data we are working with. We can use the summary function to get a quick overview of the data:

This will give us a visual representation of the distribution of each variable. From this exploration, we can see that the medv variable (median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s) is the target variable we are trying to predict.

### Data Preparation
Before we can model the data, we need to prepare it. This includes steps such as scaling and centering the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. In this example, we will focus on feature selection using explainable AI techniques.

Feature selection is the process of identifying the most important variables in the dataset that are relevant to the target variable. This can help to reduce the complexity of the model, improve its accuracy, and increase its interpretability. One way to do this is to use explainable AI techniques, such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
